# Ideas from first lecture
- Statistical evidence involves magnitude of change / variability

## Spearman correlation
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient 
- Measures monotonicity 
- More sensitive than Pearson to outliers bc Spearman only depends on ranks (drops data)

## Boxplots
- Can look similar if one is taken from an unimodal distribution and the other from bimodal
- Can look different when sample size is small even when underlying dist is the same
- Thoy do not show density 

## Rstudio
- New project > version control > git 


# Important

This has been taken from the template <https://github.com/Ismaestro/markdown-template> with introductory purposes.
